# JaaW - Jev as a Workflow

JaaW is an agent harness that **puts Jev in the driver's seat**. Thinking of an agent as a workflow generator each turn is a decision point, Jev can pick from a variety of tools and actions for the next step in the workflow.

The design behind JaaW is two-fold:

1. **Explainability**: At each turn, you can see the Jev-generated probabilities (traces)

2. **Agents as Workflows**: The UX for JaaW should feel like a workflow with a series of steps, more CLI tool than a "conversational intelligence"

## Installation

Install the latest release with curl (Linux and macOS):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmuva/jev-as-a-workflow/main/install.sh | sh
```

Install a specific version:

```bash
JEV_VERSION=v0.1.11 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmuva/jev-as-a-workflow/main/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmuva/jev-as-a-workflow/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer downloads a standalone binary and installs it as `jaaw` (by default to `~/.local/bin` on Unix). No Bun runtime is required on the target machine.

## Setup

### Requirements

**Vercel AI Gateway API Key**: You can pick one up at [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway), and allows you to toggle between different models.

### Configure

On first launch, JaaW creates `~/.jaaw/` with default `config.json`, `mcp.json`,
`mcp-auth/`, and `tools/` directories. 

1. Edit `~/.jaaw/config.json` to set your Vercel `aiGatewayApiKey` and preferred `llmModel`. Model names are found in [Vercel's mode list](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway/models).

2. \[Optional\] local skills can be placed in `~/.jaaw/skills/`.

3. \[Optional\] MCPs can be place in `~/.jaaw/mcp.json` and follow [Cursor's MCP config format](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp#installing-mcp-servers).

4. \[Optional\] `AGENTS.md` files alongside your skills

Skills, MCPs, and templates can all be toggled in each session to keep the context window focused.

## Usage

Run the installed binary:

```bash
jaaw
```

## Development

Install dependencies and run in watch mode:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Build a local standalone binary:

```bash
bun run build
./jaaw
```

Build release binaries for all supported platforms:

```bash
bun run build:all
```

## Releasing

Create and push a new version tag:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.11 -m "v0.1.11"
git push origin v0.1.11
```

Replace `v0.1.11` with the version you are releasing. Tags are pushed to GitHub and picked up by the release workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Startup** – `ensureJevHome()` creates `~/.jaaw/` and scaffolds default
   `config.json`, `mcp.json`, `mcp-auth/`, and `tools/` when missing, then
   `loadAppConfig()` reads `config.json` and populates env vars (e.g.
   `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`).
2. **Front-loading** – workspace-root instructions, enabled `AGENTS.md` content,
   and an enabled skills catalog (from `discoverSkills()` and
   `discoverAgentsMd()`) seed the conversation.
3. **MCP connect** – `mcpClient.loadConfig()` reads configuration from the
   environment, then `connectAll()` connects to every configured server (with
   optional OAuth support). If MCP setup fails, a warning message is shown in the
   UI instead of crashing.
4. **Tool loading** – `loadUserTools()` registers custom tools in the `user`
   tool-server namespace from `~/.jaaw/tools`.
5. **Capability discovery** – skills, MCP servers, user tools, and `AGENTS.md`
   files are discovered into a `CapabilityCatalog` and surfaced in the UI where
   they can be selectively enabled/toggled.
6. **Render** – the `@opentui/core` CLI renderer boots and `createRoot()` renders
   `<App />` with the seeded messages and any initial error.
7. **Agent runtime** – `jevLoop()` orchestrates the state machine (`START` →
   `PLAN` / `DISCOVERY` → `EXECUTE` → `END`, with `REWIND`), running the graph
   nodes and hooks (`compactionHook`, `rewindState`).
8. **Shutdown** – an exit handler closes all MCP connections cleanly.
